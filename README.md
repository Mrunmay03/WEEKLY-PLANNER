# WEEKLY-PLANNER

We know that working without a plan can sometimes be confusing and difficult and can also waste your lot of precious time which you wanted to save for completing your work or task.
And we know that “The anticipation of something good is really powerful.” Having a list of things you're committed to doing, even if you don't know when you'll do them, is in itself soothing. Yet planning does more than give us something to anticipate. It can also help quell anxiety by dealing with cognitive clutter.
That is why we made a “Weekly Planner” for avoiding confusion and difficulties for those people who cannot decide what to do when.
A planner helps you to write down all your tasks so it can be clear what you have to do next instead of wasting your time thinking what to do next.
